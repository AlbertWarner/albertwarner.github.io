I have been changing my CV or Resume for a few weeks now because during the holidays I was getting ready for the ICT 2018 expo at Otago University. Which I did not need to take a copy with me because most of the employees wanted electronic copies but at least I got it ready before then. Thanks to Adon, Krissi, Joy, and Elise for the help and guidance making my cv look more professional.

With me being an international student, there is a work ready program offered which is organised by the Otago Polytechnic and Otago University to help and guide international students getting a job in New Zealand.

Elise had a look at my cv and we made a few changes and she was happy with the way it was set up.

I, unfortunately, was not able to attend the CV workshop given by Adon and Elise, but I got to attend a CV workshop given by the work ready programme. This might look like a slideshow post, but the slide images explain themselves.

Reading the <a href=" https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZHJz1cDpEs6QAJzKtOwKEWCFe_xFERoFiuyDWxRQHR0/edit ">CV Workshop document </a>, I feel Adon and Elise did a much better job at this. Elisa Edwards from select recruitment had some interesting slides, as shown above but they were for more general job, where the BIT/project workshop was more about my career and it is sad I couldnâ€™t attend but I have gained a lot of knowledge from Adon and the rest of the BIT staff to put a strong CV forward that will get me into a good career.
