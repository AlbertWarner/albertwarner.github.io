In the first project class, I applied for the Web development project and with success, I got the job. Today we had a meeting with Adon and the team leader was selected. We discussed a few projects to be created by the team.

In Software Engineering I was a member of the group which created: Aviation Insuranceâ€™s(ACL) website. The ACL website required a large database and a Bootstrap theme was used to create the forms and the index page. Adon asked me to bring the team up to date on what we had completed in Software Engineering and what is still required.

I think the ACL project still has large amounts of work to be done for it to be completed but it should be a fun and interesting journey.
