Hello, Hello something new. We got some exciting news that the walking with Leon mobile app needed a website that would out put what the user did on the phone and display graphs and maps where the user walked, distance and calories etc. We meet up with the mobile team and they explained what was required. We need to receive the data from the phone in json format and store it on a database and display graphs from the information and user needs to log into the website. Big task but should be a fun learning experience.  Something new to learn
