Happy day, my team members from last semester completed most of the Helicopter controller and I just needed to do some modifications. Modified the if client or maintenance logged in. I changed all 3 users to use the select queries files. I tested a few times and checked Phpmyadmin and the correct fields in the DB are created. There are some errors on the HTML page as shown in Image 1. I will look into these and get the form working ASAP.
