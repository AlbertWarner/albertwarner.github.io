This was a good and bad day at the same time. We demonstrated the website working to Derek, first, we showed him the mobile version and with the file upload, the mobile app allows the user to select the camera to upload images or files from the phone. The only problem was my phone's images are 8mb and the site only allows 5mb. There is a requirement to increase file upload sizes. We went through the features of the website, it is saving without a button being pressed (thank you, Ajax). He seemed happy with everything but then immediately he wanted changes and extra features. It felt a little unappreciative to me, especially the work that went into the site.

To get over my unappreciative feelings, I enjoyed a good donut or 2 two which Derek brought for the team. 

We have few extra features to try implement and get the current forms working fully without any errors or problems.
