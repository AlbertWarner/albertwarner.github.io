Scrum meeting :

Aaron organised a meeting with Derek (ACL) for Wednesday 28/02/2018, attending the meeting will be Aaron, Abdel and myself. We are now in phase 1 of the ACL project and are required to get the PHP (controller classes) pushing data from the HTML to the database. The time period for this phase is 3-4 weeks. 

Abdel selected me as Gitlab moderator, to have version control of the website. Each team member is required to set up their own repository and to push to the master on a regular basis.

Adon asked us to have a working version of the website every 2 weeks. If a member was pulled to another project, the website should be working. This is proper version control, release early and regularly.

We have selected dates for the group meetings /scrums and this will be on Monday 12:30 â€“ 13:00 and Wednesday's 12:30-13:00 and maybe Thursdays as well.

Each team member selected an HTML document and was required to go through the controller and add try catches to the PHP because there was only one big try catch on the Aircraft controller. This will help with error checking. I selected the aircraft controller to see which part of HTML is not pushing to the database. So far, the information is pushing through, just need to do some more testing. In Software Engineering, we used the aircraft controller to demonstrate our work and this will be a good model for the other members to follow.
