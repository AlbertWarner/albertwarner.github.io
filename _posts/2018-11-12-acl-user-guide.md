Documentation is always important, especially for other developers and for users wanting to use your website. Design and build are always fun, but the documentation is just as important. I hope I got this right. Interesting to think out of the box and explain to a user without using technical grammar.

I wonâ€™t be explaining much the guide pretty much explain themselves.
