Welcome Derek, to your new Website. We Implemented all the features that Derek wanted from the previous meeting and showed them off to him. He was super impressed and wants us to carry on and he will pay, we said Adon had made the decision on that. This is great to see your hard work pay off and the client can now test it with live data. 

Had to bring Adon into the meeting a show him a happy customer. This was a small beast of a website. 

We just told him we had a few bugs to fix on the live website and some user guides to finish and he should be free to use it. I think he will be coming to showcase to see the finished product. 

I asked Aleen if she was not busy to come to help us out with user testing, she has found a few bugs but been able to repair them which is very awesome. Thank you, Aleen.
