My person feeling, I want to learn Django properly and Try to use it with React, spoke to Adon about this and he seems ok with it, he said whatever I am comfortable with. I would like to learn something new and get to do some programming with web. My main goal here is to learn and build on the experience of the Django MVC and hoping to be successful, letâ€™s get started.

So today was an interesting day, did some refreshing on python by watching a YouTube video.

Nice to practicing code again. Programming is a fun skill that I have enjoyed, and I will always aim to develop this skill.

I also did a refresher course on Django from YouTube

This was a good start and I will move forward to learning Rest-Django-framework because we will be working with a Rest-Api
