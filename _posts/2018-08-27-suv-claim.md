The SUV claim form had some differences to the normal forms, I copied the insert functions from the other forms, but the form required extra equipment insert functions.

<h3>Insert Functions for Equipment </h3>
```php

createEquipment($pdo,$incidentID,"Loss");
                    createEquipment($pdo,$incidentID,"Associated");
                    createEquipment($pdo,$incidentID,"Hired");
 ```
 
I had to create the following sections on the SUV claim form:

<h3>Sections on claim form created </h3>
```php
 <!--Witnesses-->
        <?php include_once ($formSuvUrl . 'witness.php');?>
        <?php include_once ($formSuvUrl . 'witnessDetails.php');?>
        <?php include_once ($formSuvUrl . 'lossOrDamage.php');?>
        <?php include_once ($formSuvUrl . 'associatedEquip.php');?>
        <?php include_once ($formSuvUrl . 'hiredEquip.php');?>
        <h3 class="text-center">Third party property damage or injury</h3>
        <?php include_once ($formComponentUrl . 'thirdPartyContactDetails.php');?>
        <?php include_once ($formSuvUrl.'thirdPartyDetails.php') ?>
        <h3 class="text-center">Additional Information</h3>
        <?php include_once ($formSuvUrl . 'propertyDamage.php');?>
        <?php include_once ($formSuvUrl.'attachFiles.php');?>                         
        <h2 class="text-center">Declaration</h2>
        <?php include_once ($formComponentUrl . 'declaration.php');?>
```

For the witness components, I copied passengers from the aircraft components and edit the headings to say witness. 

To start off while looking at the extra equipment fields there are two fields in the DB not accounted for, meaning I have no place to store the data from 2 input fields of the equipment, so I had to manually add “Manufactured by” and “Additional Information” columns to the Database and don’t forget the setup file, which builds the DB from scratch, otherwise errors will fly like the wind. 

For the extra equipment fields such loss or Damage etc, I had to add extra select queries, but the equipment table has an associative table, which deals with the many to many relationships from incident to equipment. I did one query and it produced all the information required for the different input fields on the HTML. 

<h3>Equipment Query </h3>
```php
$generalQuery43="SELECT * FROM equipment JOIN incidentEquipment ON equipment.id = incidentEquipment.equipmentID WHERE incidentEquipment.incidentID = $incidentID ";
                                            $stmt = $pdo->prepare($generalQuery43);
                                            $stmt->execute();  
                                            $generalResult43 = $stmt->fetchAll();

 ```
 
<h3>Out from above query </h3>
```php

$LossequipID = $generalResult43[1]['id'];
                                            $LossequipType = $generalResult43[1]['type']; 
                                            $LossequipMake = $generalResult43[1]['make'];
                                            $LossequipModel = $generalResult43[1]['model'];
                                            $LossequipSerial = $generalResult43[1]['serialNum'];
                                            $LossequipYear = $generalResult43[1]['yearOfManufacture'];
                                            $LossequipDesc = $generalResult43[1]['description'];
                                            $LossequipManu = $generalResult43[1]['manufacturer'];
```

Very nice to do one query and get all the information that I was looking for out, not like on the comments query where I had to do 4 separate queries on the same table.

In the models I had edit the equipment file to add an extra update function to handle the new data going to the DB, I could have modified the previous one but thought I might need to edit all the other controllers and create variables with hard-coded strings to pass to the DB for the 2 additional fields added. Lots of work though, why not create a new function that only this controller will call.

<h3>Update Equipment Function </h3>
```php

function  updateEquipment2($pdo,$equipment)
 {
         $updateQuery = "UPDATE equipment SET
            type = :type,
            make = :make,
            model = :model,
            serialNum = :serialNum,
            yearOfManufacture = :yearOfManufacture,
            description = :description,
            manufacturer = :manufacturer
            WHERE  id = :id "; 
            $stmt = $pdo->prepare($updateQuery);
            $stmt->execute($equipment); 
 }

```

The controller worked great and the SUV claim form pushed to and pulled from the DB with no problems
