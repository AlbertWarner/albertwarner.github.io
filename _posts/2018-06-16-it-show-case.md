This was a fun evening, I must admit a bit worry, I thought the event would be a big disappointment for the team and I because all afternoon we were still working on the website. I thought there would be a massive explosion of errors when the submit button was pressed.  This was not to be the case, the website seemed to work. We could push to DB and display the data. I got to demonstrate the Website to a few people and they seemed to be interested. For those who knew about coding were surprised at the amount of code and the mobile display worked well. It was a good end to all the pain and suffering but was a lot of fun, I have learned a lot about PHP and directories.
