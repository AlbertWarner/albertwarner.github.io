Audacious is set up to help people or, a better word, Entrepreneur’s find guidance and information to develop their company ideas.  One of the main objectives of Audacious is to help students develop their business ideas and become young Entrepreneurs. Dunedin has one of the most thriving start-up communities in the country. Starting a business is hard and this help I think anyone would appreciate. 

I found Audacious very interesting because I have had a few company ideas for some years now. One of the main reasons for me studying was to help me create a company. I really felt that Casy (the presenter of Audacious) had an interesting speech about it being difficult to start something and not get any help. I am really sad that I did not attend the first workshop due to work commitments but hopefully, I won’t miss the next one.  

There is a space where Entrepreneurs can work, get help and have free coffee for those late nights developing their idea’s, this is sponsored by Audacious. 

Education perfect which is an online learning platform, this is an international company that has helped many people and was were created through Audacious.

Workshops where people meet up and pitch their ideas and people can give you feedback and help to develop the idea.

Reverse pitch, companies with problems can ask people for innovative ideas on how to solve these problems.

Half-baked game:

We were split into team’s where we were given three words to pitch a company idea and in 30 seconds we had to pitch this idea to the crowd. 

The three words given to our team were: Fax, Microscopic, and Bitcoin

Our idea was to modernise the fax machine and use it to microscopically split the Bitcoin key, which is 64 characters long and it keeps your key safe in different areas.

Last, we had Tahu Mackenzie and Harvey Penfold, Winners of the 2017 Audacious Challenge, come present their work to us. They explained how Audacious helped them meet and they were able to develop their bird feeder.

To end the evening everyone got to network and find out more information.
