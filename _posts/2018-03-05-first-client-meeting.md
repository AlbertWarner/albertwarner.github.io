Derek’s feedback from what we did in Software Engineering was greatly appreciated and I was glad to hear he was happy with the work. Aaron explained to Derek that the project will be in 3 phases and we are currently in phase 1, which is getting all the pages talking to the database. Phase 2 will allow for changes and extra features. The aim is to complete each phase within 2 weeks, but time will tell as members have been moved to other projects and ACL is larger than what the group thought it would be.  

We went through what had been done in Software Engineering and Derek wanted to make some changes, we took note of these requested changes and explained that it might be possible in phase 2, depending if they are in scope.

The questions we had for Derek were:

1) Crew/passengers, what is the maximum number of people on a plane? In a normal situation, there is a pilot and learner pilot but we going to add 3 people.

2) Which fields are required, so that nulls aren’t pushed to the database? Checking the database, the way the database has been set up it will accept nulls for now.

3) The ACL number must it be manually inserted or auto-generated? Auto-generated starting with NZ joined by the year and then a starting number.
