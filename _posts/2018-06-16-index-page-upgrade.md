What have I done?

Been a bit quiet on my blog post that is for sure. As the semester nears the end, the craziness begins with all subjects. There was a need to change the claims form and add a navigation using a slider to display the menu and slide away when not needed. In software engineering, we had prepared the navigation for mobile display.

I added to the current menu system a home link pointing to the index controller and a logout link.

With the slider menu not needed I changed the current index page to look like in fig 2 given the admin a menu on the left side

The team discussed it and was happy with the change. It was nice to see the index page display neatly.

On the report list Table, I added a link tag and used bootstrap to make it look like a button. The link is for the Admin to view the claims forms and update them if necessary. The link navigates the same way as a <a href=" https://warnaa1.pages.op-bit.nz/2018/03/25/index-controller-and-client-form.html"> Client Form</a> but the link uses the Admin Form. This was another fun day in the office, good to see it working, now we can create one form and update that form instead of creating a new form every time for testing.
