I started on the index controller to create empty fields in the DB for the helicopter claim form. The helicopter form is identical to the Aircraft form with just a few minor changes. In the switch where it decides what form the user has selected, I copied and pasted the aircraft functions into the helicopter section and just renamed a few variables and removed unrequired ones.
