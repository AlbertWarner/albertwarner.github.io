Started on the DB schema for the new project. Pierre sent me a data dictionary of how the DB should be laid out and I created the schema from that, but it seemed to miss something. I asked Adon to look at it and he told me to correct the events table. Meaning every time, a person stops or started walking it would update that table.

This was an interesting start but I when I spoke to Pierre about the changes, he said that they had a new database update from their meeting and he sent to me. It pretty much the same but a bit different. I will follow their naming convention and their database dictionary, as to cause less confusion when sending the data from the phone app to the website.

Here is new DB Proposal:
