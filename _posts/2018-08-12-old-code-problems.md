This was a good day as the aircraft page was working; the pdf was populating with data and the entire page was working great with ajax. 

Let the Problems begin, I uploaded all my files to Gitlab and pushed them to the development branch, everything was fine. My team members pushed their code, they seem to have a problem, but they got the code on Gitlab. I pulled from the development branch into my branch but got a lot of merge errors, I went through them all and corrected what I wanted. Then all hell broke loose, the website went down on my side and I could not edit or create pages at all. I could have reverted to my old code, which to honest I didnâ€™t think of it at the time, but as well I wanted all the new changes made by my team members. I spent a few hours fixing the website and got everything back up and running. 

The conclusion to this, I believe we need to have a policy on putting code onto Gitlab and making sure your code is up to date. This is what happened last semester with the old code and it caused many delays
