This was a nice day, makes you feel good. It is always nice to help people and try to make their life a little better. Especially when it comes to old people, that really want to learn and need that extra hand it is great to help. I found out quickly that it is not only old people that need a hand it is middle aged people as well. 

Just a breakdown of what happened had to helped a lady move files from her cell phone to a USB stick and show her how Gmail worked. Thought it couldn’t get any easier than that. I copied the files from her phone to the USB and showed how it works. Then reset her password on Gmail and got her access to that. I taught her a bit about emails and how to send and respond to emails, basically explained it like a text message but she can do much more. Then she asked me about Facebook and getting FB messenger on  her phone I downloaded it but it required her username and password and she had set up FB on a different email address and didn’t know the password and this got a bit difficult, I hope she got it sorted because we ran out time and I tried my best to explain everything and if she just learned just one thing that would have been awesome for me.

This was a great learning experience and fun to do and nice to help the community. Jacky seemed to be impressed with our work which is another bonus.
