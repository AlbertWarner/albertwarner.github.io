What have I done?
 
Working on completing the aircraft controller to push to the database. Created the insert queries to push data from the weather and weight input fields to the database.

Kanban – need to create a Kanban. The team selected Trello to host the Kanban. I have some questions about the structure of the different groups and how that affects the Kanban but that will be asked in the next scrum.

What are my obstacles? 

The comment input fields are straightforward and should easily push to the database but aren’t and I need to find out why. Then the aircraft controller should be complete.

Time – 2 team members have been moved to a new project, and this puts more pressure on the remaining 3 members of the ACL group to keep pushing hard 

Want to achieve? 

I would like the Aircraft controller completed by today and start on a new controller.
