Where to start, so many good choices and so hard to choose a project that I think will be the best for my future. 

I have applied for the Web development team. The reason for this is, I would like to work in the Database industry and I feel this would give me good practice and experience in the industry. I believe that websites are the future of our industry.

I believe to be good at something you must keep practicing at it, and for me, this would be working on databases. My strengths are the backend of websites, but my weaknesses would be styling. This would give me the opportunity to strengthen my weaknesses.
