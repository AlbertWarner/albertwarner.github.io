Project 2 begins, let the fun begin.

I ended off project one with a few mix feelings, as I wanted to get finished with Aviation Insurance and move on to better projects and learn new MVC that would be required in the industry.

I finished the last semester thinking there wonâ€™t be an end to this project because this is a small beast of a website. I think our decision for using PHP at the beginning of the project could have been challenged.

I feel I am being punished for some reason because new people join the group and get new projects, but I am stuck on the same project since software engineering, 3 Semesters (if you include this semester) I feel unchallenged.

I tried over the semester break to get most of it finished or at least one page doing everything correctly, then the other pages could be copied exactly the same but with minor changes in the queries.

Oh well, let me get to work.
