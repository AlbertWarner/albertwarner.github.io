The third-party form was another straightforward form, same as the helicopter or the aircraft form, I copied all the components required to build the claim form from the aircraft and did the same for the controller. There were 3 extra input fields for the third-party person as shown in image 1, No extra queries were required as this form followed the norm, even the extra field that was created, I had already queried the database and had the information ready just for these fields.

This form was straightforward and I am Impressed by my forward thinking in the queries. The form was tested, and all input fields are pushing to the DB with the Ajax and no problems at all. Even though it seems to be straightforward, it is nice to see things working.
