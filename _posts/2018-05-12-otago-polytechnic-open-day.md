The Otago Polytechnic had an open day and we were asked by Adon to show off our projects to the year 13's. This would demonstrate to them what type of work we do at Polytechnic and maybe intrigue them to take the course. 

I believe this is very interesting and positive aspect of New Zealand and their education system, the reason I say this because in South Africa, you get to Matric which is the grade 10 at high school there and if your grades were not at a certain level, there was no way you could get into university. Which is kind of the same here but the students at this age are shown what is available at the university, which can give them a push to work hard and see what fun you can have studying. I donâ€™t know if other institutes do the same, but I believe this can always have a positive influence on the youth to learn.

I was a bit nervous because most of the time in my professional career and at the Polytechnic, I have demonstrated to people that were adults, you feel you have to present in a certain way or you lose the students attention. The other problem is our project is not the best-looking website in the aspect of "wow look at that, man that is a awesome website and it stands out". What I mean is, to a developer, they would understand what has gone into creating this website but to a student who might not know a lot about the code that has gone into the website , might look at it and think it is boring. 

There was one young man, who was very interesting and fully understood the code behind the page that I was showing, which was the index page and the aircraft page. He even asked about node.js which we are doing in web 3. It was nice to maybe intrigue one person and know he might come study at the Polytechnic because of what he saw.
