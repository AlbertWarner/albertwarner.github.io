Martin asked us to set up our issue in Gitlab as a Kanban. We did this in project one with Trello and it was an interesting and helpful tool to keep track of what people were doing, completing small tasks at hand and not letting the project get out of scope.

We have completed 2 tasks on the Board so far and I am busy with a few more tasks to do. I like this way of working because the work is planned, and it is an industry practice.  

Another thing to add to the CV soon I hope.
