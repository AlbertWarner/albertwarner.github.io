Hi, my name is Albert Warner and this is my Online Porfolio for 3rd year Project. <br></br>
I am a Third year student at Otago Polytechnic , studying the Bachelor of Information Technology.
This is my Online profile for Project 1 and Project 2.
I applied to work with the Web Development Team and we got to work with a client called Aviation Insurance Limited for Project 1.
As I head into project 2 , I finished up the Aviation Insurance Website (This website is small beast, on it's own).
Aviation Insurance came slowly to end and I picked up a second project which I designed in Django using a Bootstrap template.
I hope you enjoy the read
