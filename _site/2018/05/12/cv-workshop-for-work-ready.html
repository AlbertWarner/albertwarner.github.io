				<h2>CV workshop for Work Ready</h2>
				<p>12 May 2018</p>
			</header><p>I have been changing my CV or Resume for a few weeks now because during the holidays I was getting ready for the ICT 2018 expo at Otago University. Which I did not need to take a copy with me because most of the employees wanted electronic copies but at least I got it ready before then. Thanks to Adon, Krissi, Joy, and Elise for the help and guidance making my cv look more professional.</p>

<p>With me being an international student, there is a work ready program offered which is organised by the Otago Polytechnic and Otago University to help and guide international students getting a job in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Elise had a look at my cv and we made a few changes and she was happy with the way it was set up.</p>

<p>Figure 3. Showing if I run out of space for referees, what layout I can choose</p>

<p>I, unfortunately, was not able to attend the CV workshop given by Adon and Elise, but I got to attend a CV workshop given by the work ready programme. This might look like a slideshow post, but the slide images explain themselves.</p>

<p>Reading the <a href=" https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZHJz1cDpEs6QAJzKtOwKEWCFe_xFERoFiuyDWxRQHR0/edit ">CV Workshop document </a>, I feel Adon and Elise did a much better job at this. Elisa Edwards from select recruitment had some interesting slides, as shown above but they were for more general job, where the BIT/project workshop was more about my career and it is sad I couldnâ€™t attend but I have gained a lot of knowledge from Adon and the rest of the BIT staff to put a strong CV forward that will get me into a good career.</p>
