				<h2>FireBrand/Shopify</h2>
				<p>09 August 2018</p>
			</header><p>I thought this was an interesting evening for professional development, got 3 different topics of information.</p>

<p>The first presenter was FireBrand explaining how a sales website should be set up and designed to attract the clients and not make them search for things. Like the developer from FireBrand said clients would rather go to a website that is easy to navigate and spend extra money on items than a website that is difficult to navigate and has cheaper items.</p>

<p>The second presenter was a Lady from Otago Polytechnic design school, that designed an umbrella with what seems to be a Raspberry Pi from images shown, which would play whale audio flies and use the umbrella as a sound amplifier.</p>

<p>Last was a Developer from Shopify explaining the new features of the system like for example, international purchases can be made from your shop and the money will already be converted to your country code and you don’t have to worry about any exchange rates.</p>

<p>I think this a very interesting, for a developer you could use this tool and develop on top of it like FireBrand do for their clients and the system handles all the purchases and stock available, and so much more. You don’t need to build this all from scratch.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was a Q &amp; A which was nice, I got to ask what companies are looking for in their Github repositories for example, if doing a website, is it best to upload the entire website or just some code for employers to see and maybe a link of the working website if possible. The manager of Firbrand said it was a good idea to show off some code, not the entire website but if you have small working code that also good to see. I knew the answer to the question, but it is always nice to have confirmation from industry people.</p>
