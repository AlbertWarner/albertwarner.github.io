<p>Code craft was an interesting experience, listening to people who have taken the unreal engine to create a project and how they fixed the bugs to make it work for them. We got to listen to an experienced developer and his idea to try and help developers in the industry. We also had Kotlin software presented to us, this would help phone developers use one developing software for Android and IOS.</p>

<p>The two talks that intrigued me the most was TDD and Kotlin, below I give a brief description of the talks and what my opinions are.</p>

<p>TDD – Test-driven development by Tim</p>

<p>I found this to be an interesting subject because not even a week earlier we got taught TDD in OOSD. It makes perfect sense creating the test before writing a new feature, running the new test and have it fail. Write the code, this code is not perfect, but it should pass the test. The code does not break or degrade any of the existing features. The main purpose of TDD would have developers test their code before implementing it in a working environment, instead of having the entire product crash because of a bug in the new feature causing conflicts.  More about TDD is explained here:  <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development "> Test-driven development</a></p>

<p>I think this way of coding could be good practice but could be complex at the same time because the coder must know what he is designing and what the feature code must do. Even Tim said he found it hard writing tests before writing code because, as a joke, he said sometimes he doesn’t know what he wants the code to do but if you know what you are doing then TDD should be best practice. I feel it will strengthen your coding because you have to create the test before writing any code, and this could help create code without any bugs in the new feature.</p>

<p>Using Kotlin to share code between Android and IOS by Albert Gao</p>

<p>Albert demonstrated to us the uses of Kotlin and how it is able to use the same code to create an Android and IOS app.</p>

<p>It was a short demonstration and so I found a website that showed more information on Kotlin with IOS and Android.     <a href="https://blog.kotlin-academy.com/multiplatform-native-development-in-kotlin-now-with-ios-a8546f436eec"> Kotlin</a></p>

<p>Reading the article <a href=" https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/10/kotlin_killing_java_among_android_devs/ "> Kotlin killing java among android</a>, really shows the move from JAVA to Kotlin. This is interesting because I liked Java as a programming language and it is good to keep updated with the direction of the language. I must admit I don’t like Android studio so much only because of all its updates. It sometimes takes 5 min before you can start working on a project because it’s checking all the updates. Yes, I know I can switch them off in the settings menu, but the development tool is always changing and sometimes you feel if you switch the updates off for like 6 months, your app might not work because it’s not compatible with the current Android system on the phone.  It is also a mission to move your app from one computer to another because of these updates. I don’t know if Kotlin can change this because they would still need to use the library’s and allow for updates. This is an interesting move in the JAVA world, but I think it would be user preference that wins at the end. Still, good knowledge to keep yourself up to date because maybe Kotlin is pushed by Google as its primary development tool.</p>
