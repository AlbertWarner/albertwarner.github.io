We Implemented all the features that Derek wanted from the previous meeting and showed them off to him. He was super impressed and wants us to carry on and he will pay, we said Adon had made the decision on that. This is great to see your hard work pay off and the client can now test it with live data.

We need to show on a map with indications of where the user walked on a google maps. I went searching for some javascript or how to imply what I want on google maps, my searches were coming up with some hard work. Then Alex came to talk to me and we got chatting about what I was looking for and he said I must use  Leaflet  Wow was this an amazing site and so well documented, I love this.

The whole reason for the archive list is for Derek to archive his old claim forms and I stated the best way to do this is by implementing a 1 or 0 feature.

Django is very similar to Flask but as explained you have to do the Django way, or it won’t work, Flask has more freedom to develop the way you want.

Pierre sent me a data dictionary of how the DB should be laid out and I created the schema from that, but it seemed to miss something. I asked Adon to look at it and he told me to correct the events table. Meaning every time, a person stops or started walking it would update that table.

			<h2><a href="http://localhost:4000/2018/10/04/interesting-database-find.html">Interesting Database Find</a></h2><p>04 October 2018</p></header><p>Was I mistaken on my previous post of everything working well? Small problem, every time a user opened a claim form, or the admin saved the form the date created column, which is a “timestamp” in MYSQL would update at the same time. I thought it was because we were using a date, time function of PHP and updating the table with it and this was causing the DB to update the column. I removed the PHP date function and still was doing the same thing.

Which I did not need to take a copy with me because most of the employees wanted electronic copies but at least I got it ready before then. Thanks to Adon, Krissi, Joy, and Elise for the help and guidance making my cv look more professional.

The Report HTML forms have to be made from scratch, with the extra manpower this would be a great opportunity to get that work out of the way.

Aaron explained to Derek that the project will be in 3 phases and we are currently in phase 1, which is getting all the pages talking to the database. Phase 2 will allow for changes and extra features. The aim is to complete each phase within 2 weeks, but time will tell as members have been moved to other projects and ACL is larger than what the group thought it would be.

Software Engineering was an interesting learning experience and I would like it to be noted in my work. Getting back to the reason for my first post being about Jekyll.
